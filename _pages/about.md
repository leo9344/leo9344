# Biography

Hi, I'm Li Zuoou. Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹ 

Currently I am a senior student majoring in *Artificial Intelligence* at *Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)* and a research assistant at *The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ)*, supervised by Prof. [Zhizheng Wu](https://drwuz.com/).

I was a research intern at Robotics Lab of *Beijing Institute of General Artificial Intelligence ([BIGAI](https://bigai.ai/))*, working closely with Dr. Boren Li and Dr. Wanlin Li. And I was a member of autonomous system group in *Beijing Institute of Technology Formula Student Driverless* ([*BITFSD*](http://www.bitfsd.com/)), which have won many championships of Formula Student Autonomous China (FSAC).

Recently, I'm focusing on **Audio-Visual DeepFake and Detection**, If you are also interested, please feel free to contact me.
