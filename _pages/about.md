# Biography

Hi, I'm Li Zuoou. Nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹ 

Currently I am an *MSc Computing (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning)* student at *Imperial College London*, and a research assistant at *Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology, Peking University*, working closely with Dr. Xiaoyu Zhou.

Previously, I was a research assistant at *The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ)*, supervised by Prof. [Zhizheng Wu](https://drwuz.com/). I was a research intern at Robotics Lab of *Beijing Institute of General Artificial Intelligence ([BIGAI](https://bigai.ai/))*, working closely with Dr. Boren Li and Dr. Wanlin Li. And I was a member of autonomous system group in *Beijing Institute of Technology Formula Student Driverless* ([*BITFSD*](http://www.bitfsd.com/)), which have won many championships of Formula Student Autonomous China (FSAC).

Recently, I'm focusing on **3D Reconstruction** and **3DGS**, If you are also interested, please feel free to contact me.

## Experiences

Research Assistant, Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology, Peking University      
Mar. 2024 â€“ Present 
- Focusing on 3D large-scale scene reconstruction and physics integrated weather synthesis based on 3DGS. 

Research Assistant, School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology          
Aug. 2023 - Feb. 2024
- Concentrated on the challenge of error accumulation caused by domain shifts in long-term testing sequences 
- Constructed a structural causal model to show the presence of a backdoor path linking feature representation and model predictions due to contextual knowledge in the current model, resulting in spurious correlations 
- Designed and implemented a Causal Adaptation in Test-Time module to effectively block the backdoor path through causal intervention 

Research Assistant, School of Data Science, [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ)](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/), Oct. 2022 - present
